        <h3>Delicious, soft, and chewy brownie cookies that are quick and simple!</h3>
        
        <p>We all know that homemade brownies are exceptionally rich. And when it comes to brownie cookies, these are the richest. They're extra chewy with soft fudge-like centers.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Brownie mix (1 Packet)</li>
            <li>All Purpose Flour (1/4 Cup)</li>
            <li>Vegetable Oil (1/4 Cup)</li>
            <li>Water (3 tbsp)</li>
            <li>Eggs (2)</li>
            <li>Semisweet chocolate chips (1 Cup)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Combine brownie mix, flour, oil, water, eggs, and chocolate chips in a large bowl. Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until cookies are just set (about 9 minutes). Let cool on baking sheets for 2 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.            </li>
